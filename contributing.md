# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a
[Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this
project you agree to abide by its terms.

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Use the conventional format to add new plugin reference: `[Plugin Name](https://plugin-vendor-reference) by Vendor Name - short description. [Demo](https://demo-video-reference)`
- Add ðŸ†“ label if the plugin is free or has a free version suitable for indefinite use (not just a trial version with time constraints).
- Make sure the description is concise and informative. Avoid marketing style adjectives describing the plugins like "best", "amazing", "awesome", etc.
- Make sure you pick the correct category for the plugin, or create a new one if nothing fitts.
- If you add new category, please update the table of contents. You may use `bin/toc` script, based on [`doctoc`](https://github.com/thlorenz/doctoc) tool.

Thank you for your suggestions!

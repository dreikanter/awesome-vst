# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a
[Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this
project you agree to abide by its terms.

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Use the conventional format to add a new plugin reference: [Plugin Name](https://plugin-vendor-reference) by Vendor Name - short description. [Demo](https://demo-video-reference).
- Add the ðŸ†“ label if the plugin is free or has a free version suitable for indefinite use (not just a trial version with time constraints).
- Ensure the description is concise and informative. Avoid marketing-style adjectives to describe the plugins such as "best", "amazing", "awesome", etc.
- Ensure you select the correct category for the plugin, or create a new one if nothing fits.
- If you add a new category, please update the table of contents. You may use the `bin/toc` script, which is based on the [`doctoc`](https://github.com/thlorenz/doctoc) tool.

Thank you for your suggestions!
